    # the associated derivatives (class Derivatif), and [c,G] the associated constants
    # (class Constant), then the term c*x*y**2*z will have signature "112..1". The leading
    # '112' means that there are three variables appearing in the term, two of which
    # are raised to the 1st power and one of which is raised to the 2nd power. The '..'
    # indicates that there are no derivatives in the term, and the final 1 indicates that
    # there is one constant in the term, and it is raised to the 1st power. Another example
    # is G**2*dxdt**2dydt, which would have signature ".12.2". Just like EquationSystem._lookupDict,
    # this dictionary is associated with the variables, derivatives and constants specified in
    # EquationSystem._LastVarsDerivsAndConstants.
